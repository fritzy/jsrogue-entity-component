#Entity Component

This is a ECMAScript 2015 (JavaScript/ES6) Entity-styled Component System for roguelikes and other games inspired by [Brian Bucklew's IRDC US 2015 Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U03XXzcThGU).

A Component based approach to games allows you to add functionality without reorganizing your object code to handle new features, and is a popular approach to modern game development.

## Install

`npm i --save @jsrogue/entity-component`

## Example

```javascript
'use strict';

let EC = require('@jsrogue/entity-component');

class Health extends EC.Component {
    constructor(stats) {
        super(stats);
        this.stats.hp = stats.hp || 10;
        this.handlerMap.takeHit = {
            func: this.handleHit,
            priority: 100
        }
    }

    handleHit(event) {
        this.stats.hp -= event.dmg;
        return event;
    }
}

class Armor extends EC.Component {
    constructor(stats) {
        super(stats);
        this.handlerMap.takeHit = {
            func: this.handleHit,
            priority: 50
        }
    }

    handleHit(event) {
        event.dmg *= .5;
        return event;
    }
}

let person = new EC.Entity();
let health = new Health({hp: 100});
let armor = new Armor();
person.addComponent(health);
person.addComponent(armor);
person.emit('takeHit', {dmg: 8});
console.log(person.stats); // {hp: 96}
```
